## About
Welcome to my HackerEarth Problem Solutions repository. I'm Mohammad Shafqat Siddiqui, and this repository contains my solutions to HackerEarth's Practice Section problems.

### Suggestion
In this repository, you will find solutions to HackerEarth Practice Section problems implemented in different programming languages. The code is written in a concise, one-lined format for easy reference. However, I encourage you to format and expand the code as needed to understand the underlying approach and logic.

Please note that while these solutions are provided for reference, I strongly advise against submitting them without a thorough understanding of the problem's logic.

### File Organization
* Solutions are organized alphabetically by file name.
* I primarily use Python for problem-solving, but you may also find solutions in C++ for select problems.

Feel free to explore the solutions and adapt them to your own learning and problem-solving journey.
